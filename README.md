# volume_control_using_hand_gesture
I have made a model which controls the volume of the device using the hand gesture movements.
Various libraries like cv2 and mediapipe were used to detect hand, hand gestures and access volume control through it.
The model is ready and probably required a hardware to be installed with it for further use with t.v, further can be improvised on Air conditioner(to lower or raise the temperature) and with refrigerator as the same.
The model is ready.

TEST VIDEO IS ATTACHED IN THE REPOSITORY.
